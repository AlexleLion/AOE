## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

The primary dataset my team works on is a detailed examination of space exploration's evolution and significant milestones, beginning with the Soviet Union's pioneer Sputnik launch in 1957. This event ignited the Space Race, mainly between the Soviet Union and the United States. Our dataset, sourced from Next Spaceflight, records 4,287 space missions, detailing launch dates, mission names, organizing bodies, launch sites, outcomes, types, destinations, and costs where available.

The supplementary dataset incorporates information on astronauts from NASA, Roscosmos, and various fan-based sources up to January 15, 2020. It offers insights into astronauts' names, genders, birthdates, nationalities, military statuses, and selection programs, alongside mission-specific details like shuttle names and EVA durations. The details make the work more interesting.

The second supplementary dataset from NASA's Open Data Portal focuses on extra-vehicular activity (EVA) for the U.S. and Russia. This includes 371 entries detailing spacewalks, with information on EVA numbers, countries, crew, vehicles, dates, durations, and purposes.

When looking at the historical background, the primary dataset also reflects the influence of U.S. President John F. Kennedy's vision for space exploration. Kennedy's enterprising goal, articulated in the early 1960s, aimed to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade. This vision directly responded to the Soviet Union's early space achievements and significantly accelerated the U.S. space program, marking a critical moment in the Space Race.




### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
