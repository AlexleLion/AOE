## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

The primary source [All Space Missions from 1957 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957/data) my team works on is a detailed examination of space exploration's evolution and significant milestones, beginning with the Soviet Union's pioneer Sputnik launch in 1957. This event ignited the Space Race, mainly between the Soviet Union and the United States. Our dataset, sourced from Next Spaceflight, records 4,287 space missions, detailing launch dates, mission names, organizing bodies, launch sites, outcomes, types, destinations, and costs where available.

The supplementary source [Astronaut Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/astronaut-database) incorporates information on astronauts from NASA, Roscosmos, and various fan-based sources up to January 15, 2020. It offers insights into astronauts' names, genders, birthdates, nationalities, military statuses, and selection programs, alongside mission-specific details like shuttle names and EVA durations. The details make the work more interesting.






### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
