### Dataset

The primary dataset we utilize [All Space Missions from 1957 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957/data) offers a comprehensive examination of the evolution of space exploration and its significant milestones. This examination begins with the Soviet Union's pioneering Sputnik launch in 1957, an event that ignited the Space Race primarily between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sourced from Next Spaceflight, our dataset encompasses records of 4,287 space missions, detailing launch dates, mission names, organizing bodies, launch sites, outcomes, mission types, destinations, and available cost data. Below is a sample from the dataset, illustrating the structured information it contains. It's important to note that the dataset is predominantly clean, with only a few entries containing null values.

The supplementary source [Astronaut Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/astronaut-database) provides a detailed profile of astronauts from NASA, Roscosmos, and fan-based compilations up to January 15, 2020. It captures essential biographical data, including names, gender, birth years, and nationalities, alongside their professional backgrounds, distinguishing between military and civilian careers.

The dataset offers in-depth mission-specific information, including selection details, mission titles, shuttle names, and EVA durations. This rich collection of data not only illuminates the individual journeys of astronauts but also enhances our understanding of the broader narrative of human space exploration, making it an invaluable tool for analysis and research. The absence of empty values in the dataset ensures its cleanliness, thereby requiring minimal filtering to extract the most interesting columns.






### Problematic

Project Overview and Motivation:
Our visualization project delves into the fascinating realm of space exploration, not merely from a technological standpoint but as a reflection of geopolitical development and national prowess. At its core, this project aims to provide a historical narrative, showcasing how pivotal moments in space exploration have been influenced by broader political and societal factors. A significant focus is on the transformative vision set forth by U.S. President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s, which epitomized the U.S.'s commitment to not just match but surpass Soviet achievements in space. This endeavor underscores a key period in the Space Race, highlighting how Kennedy's ambitious goal of moon landing before the decade's end catalyzed the American space program.

Objectives and Target Audience:
The primary objective is to chart a timeline of crucial milestones in space exploration, illustrating the interplay between technological achievements and their geopolitical implications. By visualizing this timeline, we aim to provide insights into how space exploration has influenced and been shaped by countries' developmental narratives.

Furthermore, the project aims to celebrate the human aspect of space exploration. By profiling the trailblazers – the first astronauts, their backgrounds, occupations, and unique contributions – we offer a tribute to their enduring legacy. This aspect of the visualization seeks to inform and inspire a diverse audience, ranging from space enthusiasts and historians to aspiring engineers and astronauts. It serves as a resource for those curious about the personal journeys of these pioneers and provides context for individuals aiming to contribute to the field of space exploration, whether in astronautics, satellite communication, or related sectors.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
