### Dataset

The primary dataset we utilize [All Space Missions from 1957 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957/data) offers a comprehensive examination of the evolution of space exploration and its significant milestones. This examination begins with the Soviet Union's pioneering Sputnik launch in 1957, an event that ignited the Space Race primarily between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sourced from Next Spaceflight, our dataset encompasses records of 4,287 space missions, detailing launch dates, mission names, organizing bodies, launch sites, outcomes, mission types, destinations, and available cost data. Below is a sample from the dataset, illustrating the structured information it contains. It's important to note that the dataset is predominantly clean, with only a few entries containing null values.

The supplementary source [Astronaut Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/astronaut-database) provides a detailed profile of astronauts from NASA, Roscosmos, and fan-based compilations up to January 15, 2020. It captures essential biographical data, including names, gender, birth years, and nationalities, alongside their professional backgrounds, distinguishing between military and civilian careers.

The dataset offers in-depth mission-specific information, including selection details, mission titles, shuttle names, and EVA durations. This rich collection of data not only illuminates the individual journeys of astronauts but also enhances our understanding of the broader narrative of human space exploration, making it an invaluable tool for analysis and research. The absence of empty values in the dataset ensures its cleanliness, thereby requiring minimal filtering to extract the most interesting columns.






### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
